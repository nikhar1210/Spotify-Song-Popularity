# Spotify-Song-Popularity
Predicting song's popularity based on song features like danceability, tempo, acoustics etc.


Spotify is a digital music and video streaming service that gives users access to songs and other content from artists all over the world. Spotify is the most-used music streaming service globally with 180 million active users, including over 83 million paying subscribers. Spotify is a publicly traded company valued at around $30 billion.

Spotify uses several algorithms to determine a track popularity, but in general the more a song is played the higher its popularity. The popularity rating is based on total number of plays compared to other tracks as well as how recent those plays are. The popularity of a track is a value between 0 and 100, with 100 being the most popular.

The popularity of a track is based on 
(1) the total number of plays compared to other tracks and 
(2) how recent those plays are.

I wanted to test the hypothesis that popularity of a given song can be predicted from several audio and track characteristics, including predictor variables like speachiness, danceability, and tempo. I also explored the impact of genre on song popularity.

Testing these hypotheses and finding a good model can help musicians and music production companies predict which songs will hit the mark of popularity, and consequently can invest time and resources in them.
